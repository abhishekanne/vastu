Vastu Application



The web application that accepts the image of layout plan of house/ flat . We need to apply the vastu rules. Like User can rotate the image as minimum as one degree. so they can align North . Currently there’s is no backend so everything happens on same session on browser

On the layout we need to direction Top is north Bottom is South.
Once user uploaded images  the toolbox appear 
TOoll box have tools 
Rotate image 
Hold and move image 
Zoom Image Zoom Out
the can rotate give rotate range textbox and plus minus button on clicking plus minus image also rortates and numbers also increase
 Degrease range is 0 to 360 degrees
Now user can move the images by holding it up down left right give hand symbol on toolbox

Upload image is step1 align Image
Once user click on next button user goes in second step where , its assumed he aligned the map top as north so we now where are other directions
In second step we allow user to draw the outer walls of the house . This is close circuit of straight multiple lines. Add dots on both ends of lines appear it red if its to connected to other lines and appear green if it connected to some other lie and making close circuit

After it makes close circuit  enable done button 
Non next step we need to identify  the centre point of the close circuit, for that we take outermost lines on each direction making it into perfect rectangle . This is imaginary rectangle . Give button to show this imaginary rectangle with dotted lines . And plot the center of the imaginary rectangle. With transparent  orange dot. Then we have to plot all possible direction lines and name it . 
User can select the number of directions he want 4,8,16
When 4 draw lines north south east to west label it 
Whe n8  addition 4 lines pointing then also label the south -east ,south west etc   
When 16 add more 8 lines and label it south-south east, etc  
You do research and tell decide the angle go lines . The top is NORTH is our guiding point 
Draw all lines from the centre point , with faded traspernet colours so the image below is still we can see. Also add button to colour the each section with different extremely transparent colours.user can off the colours by unselecting button .
Now user can click next . Non ext panel user can see the image with all line labels direction colours and now he can rotate the maps  Degrease range is 0 to 360 degrees
But this time North also rotate , this time label should be readable example If image rooted 180 degree the north now comes on bottom . So label north should be readable it should be upside down ..

At last give user button  to download the image with everything plated on it
